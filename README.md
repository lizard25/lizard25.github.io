#### CNN for ASL Character Classification
I produced and trained a model to recognize sign language characters from the following dataset: [link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)
with a ~95% accuracy (missclassified 1 in 20 characters)

#### Inverse Kinematics with Obstacle Avoidance
Implemented a robot arm with inverse kinematics using jacobian approximation that included seeking a target and avoiding obstacles as well as joint limits. Modeled in Blender and Vedo
